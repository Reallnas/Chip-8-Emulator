Small Chip 8 Emulator created by Reallnas around 2019.

The code works (or at least worked) but the Qt project needs to be set up properly to launch the application.
The only goals of this project was to apply the concepts of C++ that I just learned before and to learn how a set of instruction works.
Don't expect professional quality of code.
