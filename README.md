# Chip 8 Emulator

## Presentation

Small Chip 8 Emulator created by Reallnas around 2019.

The only goals of this project were to apply the concepts of C++ that I just learned before and to learn how a set of
instruction works. Don't expect professional quality of code.

## Controls

The original Chip 8 keyboard (below) :

| 0   | 1   | 2   | C   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 4   | 5   | 6   | D   |
| 7   | 8   | 9   | E   |
| A   | 0   | B   | F   |

is mapped by default to this configuration (Azerty layout):

| &   | Ã©   | "   | '   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| A   | Z   | E   | R   |
| Q   | S   | D   | F   |
